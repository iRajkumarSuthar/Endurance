# Endurance Project Context

## Purpose
Endurance is a student document intake portal for study-abroad applications with automated verification logic and live status updates.

## Current Scope (v1.0.x)
- Student portal route: `/portal`
- Real-time state polling and progress tracking
- Required documents:
  - Passport
  - Academic Transcript
  - Bank Statement
  - Statement of Purpose
  - Resume / CV
  - English Test Score
- Automated verification checks:
  - MIME type policy
  - File extension policy
  - File size bounds
  - Binary signature checks for pdf/png/jpg
  - Duplicate checksum detection
  - Filename risk and document-intent heuristics
- Triggered alerts for:
  - Missing required documents
  - Rejected files
  - Verification queue status

## Current Scope Decision
- Active production stack target: Next.js server-capable app (App Router with API routes) + Firebase Auth + Firestore + Cloud Storage.
- Hosting model for production: server-rendered Next.js deployment (no static-only export).
- Next.config now intentionally no longer uses `output: "export"`.

## Active Execution Plan

- Active plan file: `implementationplan.md`
- Current plan step: Step 5 — Real-Time Sync (No Poll-Only UX)
- Current step rationale: Step 4 rule-based alert persistence is now implemented, so the next gap is replacing poll-only sync with push-based state delivery.
- Current step progress: Step 4 completed with persisted alert lifecycle and deduplicated required-document rules.

## Constraint Baseline Lock (Step 0)

- Required documents are fixed to six types in `src/lib/student-application-schema.ts`:
  - `passport`, `transcript`, `bankStatement`, `statementOfPurpose`, `resume`, `englishTest`.
- Home page intake remains a single path: homepage CTAs route to `/portal`.
- Current storage remains local/demo-only (`localStorage` in `src/lib/application-store.ts`) and is not production-truth.
- Production implementation must use backend persistence before claiming full constraint compliance.

## Git and Remote Notes
- Branch: `master`
- Commit format: `vX.Y.Z <message>`
  - `X` major, `Y` minor, `Z` patch
- Identity used in this repo:
  - `Arjun Suthar`
  - `arjunsutar.engr@gmail.com`
- Remote: `origin` points to `git@github.com-first:ArjunSuthar-engr/Endurance.git`

## Firebase Deployment Notes
- Firebase config files have been removed from the repo.
- Production path is now server-aware and no longer requires static-export-only output.
- Current operating mode is local-only development.
- If Firebase is re-added, use a deployment path that supports Next.js APIs (not static-only hosting).

## Known Notes
- The verification state is now persisted in-browser via a local persistence layer (`localStorage`-backed demo table model).
- For production: move the same table model to server-backed DB/object storage.
- `tmp_pdf/` is excluded from source control.
- upload flow bug fix: switched ID generation from extracted `randomUUID` function to direct crypto invocation to prevent `Illegal invocation` in browsers where detached method calls are disallowed.
- The verification feed now uses a single-document viewer with top selectors and left/right navigation instead of stacking every uploaded file vertically.
- Non-negotiable constraint coverage:
  - Automated authenticity checks must run on every uploaded document.
  - Missing required files must trigger explicit missing-document notifications.
  - State and progress must update automatically after each upload and verification result.
  - Failed verification must tell the student what to change before re-uploading.
  - Students must be able to remove incorrect uploads from the packet and replace them.
  - Removing a duplicate upload must automatically clear duplicate rejection on the surviving file when no duplicate remains.

## Step 3 Completion Notes

- Added `src/lib/verification-engine.ts` to centralize server-side verification checks and scoring logic.
- Added `analyze-upload` API action in `src/app/api/application/route.ts` to run:
  - extension policy
  - MIME policy
  - file-size policy
  - binary signature validation
  - checksum and duplicate detection
  - filename intent/risk checks
- Updated upload flow in `src/lib/student-application-service.ts` so each upload calls server analysis, persists `checks` per document, and then stores final status.
- New client API contract (`analyzeUpload`) lives in `src/lib/application-backend-client.ts`.

## Step 4 Completion Notes

- Added `src/lib/application-alert-rules.ts` to classify each required document as `missing`, `rejected`, `verifying`, or `verified`.
- Alert records are now persisted and deduplicated instead of being rebuilt only in memory.
- Alert lifecycle now preserves history by marking alerts with `resolvedAt` rather than deleting them.
- Active alert keys now align with the plan:
  - `missing-documents`
  - `rejected-documents`
  - `verification-running`
- Upload flow again exposes a short verification window so in-progress alerts and requirement states are actually visible in the portal.

## Verification Guidance Notes

- Rejected uploads now return actionable remediation guidance instead of only generic failure text.
- Failed and warning checks explain what the student should change, such as:
  - re-export as an allowed format
  - compress the file
  - upload a non-duplicate document
  - rename the file clearly for the declared document type

## Immediate Next Changes (when requested)
1. Add stronger document authenticity checks (OCR / anti-tamper service).
2. Improve portal UI states and accessibility.
3. Add auth/role separation for students vs reviewers.
